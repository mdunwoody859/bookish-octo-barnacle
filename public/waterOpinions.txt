So this is a text file in which I talk about my FAVOURITE thing on the planet.
No, not Israel - water! Water is so good! It's like, fantastic! I honestly don't know how I could live without it. Do you know why? Because I literally can't!
That's the thing with water, it's so important. God I love water
