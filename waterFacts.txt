Did you know that even though water FALLS FROM THE SKY, there are communities that
do not get enough water?
This is because they made poor life choices and built their houses in deserts
Animals also had little poops in their water, and drinking that kills people.
This is bad because people die.
Did somebody say cholera? No? Ok. Well anyway, don't mess with someone's water
Even Connor's
